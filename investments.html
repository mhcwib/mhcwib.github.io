          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>The purpose of the Mount Holyoke Investment Club is to provide both theory and practice for students interested in the many facets of investing, business, and finance. Although member interests may be as narrow as “finance” or “business”, the Club also aims to explore and quantify the underlying effects of human decision making as it applies to the market (that is, behavioral finance). The Club seeks to give its members a foundational understanding of investing through tutorials, as well as through the management of a portfolio via a virtual simulator.</p> 
          <h3>Analyst Program</h3>
          <p>The Analyst Program serves to provide students with sound financial information, resources and real-world investment experience. They will learn about industry analysis, multiples and valuation, and what goes into making a successful stock pitch and/or equity research report.</p>
